# Time-Varying Principal Component Regression {-}

## Forecasting Performances on FRED-MD {-}

In this book, we report the main steps of the forecast evaluation procedure. The first chapter explains the preprocessing pipeline that we apply to the data at each step of the forecast evaluation. The second chapter reports the forecast-evaluation procedure for 10 policy-relevant variables in FRED-MD using different predictive algorithms.
